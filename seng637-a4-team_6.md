## 2.5 INSTRUCTIONS

## 2.5.1 Mutation Testing

You should run Pitest on your own test suites `DataUtilitiesTest`** and `RangeTest`** from assignment 3.

### 2.5.2 Create a new Eclipse project

Add the JFreeChart source code given in assignment 4 to your project. Add all libraries into your project. Add the given sample test codes (provided in this assignment) into your project.

## 2.5.3 Add your own Test Suites from lab 3 into your new project.

### 2.5.4 Run Mutation Testing on the sample test cases

As a practice, run mutation tests on the test cases provided under `org.jfree.data.junit` in the test folder of _JFreeChart_Lab4_ project. Record all results. (Right click on the `org.jfree.data.junit` and then run as PIT Mutation Test)


1.  Note that in order to run mutation tools successfully, your test cases must pass (all green). For example, the `DataUtilitiesTes` test case has error in `org.jfree.data.junit`, running Pitest you will get exception. If there is any defect that is found by the tests (error/failure), they need to be fixed in the code before running the mutation tool.

2.  Expect that mutation testing of some classes might take long time. Let the tool runs and do not terminate it until the test ends and you get the mutation testing reports.

### 2.5.5 Run Mutation Testing on your own test cases

- Run mutation tests on your `Range` test classes from assignment 3. Record all results.

- Run mutation tests on your `DataUtilities` test classes from lab 3. Record all results.

  - You might require to fix your test codes, if you find out that your test cases are not correct.

  - You might require to fix the source code, if your test code detects any defect.

- Analysis of at least 10 mutants produced by Pitest for the `Range` class, and how they are killed or not by your original test suite

### 2.5.6 Equivalent Mutants

Try to come up with a way that you could automatically detect a few equivalent mutants in your experimentation, for classes `Range` and `DataUtilities`. If you think you have found a way, discuss it in your report, along with its benefits, disadvantages, and assumptions. Try to detect a few equivalent mutants manually in classes `Range` and `DataUtilities` (to do this, you will need to investigate the mutation logs generated by the tool).
Report the process you followed for this part plus your findings and results in your lab report. Note that the number of equivalent mutants found is not as important as the understanding of how to detect them and the discussion of how you found them.

### 2.5.7 Add More Test Cases to increase Mutation Score

In this phase, we want to increase the mutation score. For each of the classes under mutation testing (`Range` and `DataUtilities`), measure the mutation score of your original test suites from assignment 3. Aim at increasing mutation scores for `Range` and `DataUtilities` each by at least <span style="color:green">10% <span style="color:black">, e.g., if it is <span style="color:green">55%<span style="color:black">, make it at least<span style="color:green"> 65%<span style="color:black">. Discuss in your report the test cases that you had to add to increase the mutation score, and also how you designed them.

# 4 Evaluation Criteria

## 4.1 Lab report and Test suites (100%)

Students will be required to submit a report on their work in the lab as a group. To be consistent, please use the template markdown file “Assignment4-ReportTemplate.md” provided online under the Assignment 4 folder. If desired, feel free to rename the sections, as long as the headings are still descriptive and accurate.

<span style="color:MidnightBlue   ">**NOTE2: include folder together with your report. One containing Part 1’s final test suite, another containing Selenium test scripts.**

A portion of the grade for the lab report will be allocated to organization and clarity. The report marking scheme is as follows:
